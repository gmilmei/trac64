# TRAC T-64 Programming Language

TRAC is a purely text-based and interactive language, also called
"reactive typewriter" by its inventor Calvin Mooers. It was developed
between 1959 and 1964 and implemented on a PDP-10. It influenced many
later macro processors, such as M4.

## Installation

The source code is C99 POSIX.1-2008. The only requirements are `gcc`
and `make`. To build, run `make all`. Optimization flags can be set
using the make variable `OPTFLAGS`. To install, run `make
install`. Installation flags are, as usual, `BINDIR`, `MANDIR` and
`DESTDIR`.
